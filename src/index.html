					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Daniel, also going by the handle danishKodeMonkey. I am a
						programmer on a epic, ever-lasing quest to become a smarter
						full-stack web-developer. I have a absolute passion about making
						websites. This is both from a design standpoint, making a vision on
						paper come to life on the screen. And a practical one, making all
						kinds of the most wacky ideas and functions work. My guilty
						pleasures include a immense amount of coffee, and solving tough
						problems and errors on projects. Join me on my journey to become
						stronger by checking out my GitHub!
